## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.
I chose the Blackjack. A Card game where you play against the dealer and the main goal is to reach 21 with the card the dealer gives you or having a higher hand than him.

## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.
Each round you reacive 2 cards. If one of the is an As, you can choose the valeu of it between 1 or 11.
The dealer will have the same.

Then you chose to Hit(receive another card), Stand(not receiving more cards) and Pass(passing the round and the dealer win it)
If you hit, the sum of the card must be 21 or lower, if not you loss. Then, the dealer get many card he want until he reach 17 or higher. 
Stand is the same as hit but without the player receiving a card.

You compare the sum of your cards and the dealer cards.If the dealer get 21, he wins. If he gets lower than 21 and you have 21, you win. If you score is over the dealer one, you win. If you score is under the dealer one, you win.

-update the readme

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
I used Trello for organizing my work. I did basic steps as look information of the game, start coding the game, etc. I did have some problems with the organization inside Trello because usually a do on use any kind of tool as this one, I discause with my team members and divide and help each-other.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
My repository has 1 folder where you can finde this Readme.md file and the actual game file. Moreover, there is a .gitignore file to reduce the amount of bytes inside the repository. Outside of the folder, there is the file to kick off the game
